This project uses Power BI to present a deep-dive data analysis of the T20 World Cup 2024. It leverages ball-by-ball delivery data and match-level summaries to uncover team strategies, player performance, and match-winning patterns. Built for data storytelling, this dashboard provides interactive visuals and analytical KPIs that uncover meaningful cricket insights.

## What This Dashboard Analyzes

* Match outcomes based on toss decisions

* Team performance while batting first vs chasing

* Player of the Match trends

* Batting strike rate vs run accumulation

* Bowling efficiency and economy under pressure

* Venue impact on outcomes

* Batsmen and bowlers with standout performances

# Analytical Insights Derived

**Toss Influence**: Only ~50% of toss winners go on to win the match, showing that match-day execution is more important than toss luck.

**Win Patterns**: A majority of matches were won by runs (defending), showing the strength of bowling units in this World Cup.

**Boundary Analysis**: Over 1500 boundaries were hit, with 983 fours and 520 sixes — reflecting aggressive batting intent.

**Venue Analysis**: Certain venues heavily favored defending totals, such as Bridgetown and North Sound.

**Bowling Economy**: Top bowlers with more than five overs bowled had economies under 6.0 — crucial in the T20 format.
